### Code review repo
Repo to hold stuff for "code review" on Monday afternoon.
## Directions
Please put the associated model and training script in the respective directories. I assume you only have one script, but it's fine if they're broken up. The only thing I ask is that you clearly label who's file it is, and if they're borken up which scripts contain the model, and which contains the training script(if they're in seperate files).
If you have any questions, please slack me.
